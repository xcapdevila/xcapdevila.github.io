    "summary": "With over 11 years of experience, I am a passionate and hands-on Software Architect specializing in payments systems, Fintech solutions, and e-commerce platforms. My expertise lies in designing and implementing scalable, secure architectures that meet business goals while adhering to the highest technical standards. I have led the development of PCI-DSS compliant systems and architected distributed platforms, building high-performance solutions capable of processing millions of transactions daily.\n Currently, as a Software Architect at Inditex, I design enterprise-grade IT systems across cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP) and on-premise environments, employing advanced design patterns and best practices for performance, security, and maintainability. My focus is on creating complex, elegant architectures that adapt seamlessly to evolving requirements and technologies.\n I have a substantial background in the payments domain, where I’ve designed and developed digital payment platforms supporting various methods, including credit cards, wallets, direct debit, and Alternative Payment Methods (APMs). My expertise also encompasses implementing effective fraud prevention mechanisms and enhancing operational efficiency through innovative technologies.\n I thrive on collaborating with stakeholders to transform business objectives into technically sound solutions. My commitment to architectural excellence drives me to apply proven design patterns, microservices architecture, and cloud-native strategies to develop resilient and scalable systems. I am dedicated to continuous learning, leveraging the latest technologies and management methodologies to ensure each solution meets the highest standards.\n In addition to my technical focus, I bring leadership experience in Agile methodologies, successfully serving as a Product Owner and Scrum Master. I have guided teams through Agile transformations and managed up to 12 engineers. While Agile is part of my toolkit, my core passion lies in building exceptional technical solutions and fostering a culture of technical excellence within development teams.\n Let’s connect if you want to discuss payment systems, complex architectures, or the latest trends in software design and development! I am eager to explore opportunities for collaboration and share insights on emerging technologies.\n",
